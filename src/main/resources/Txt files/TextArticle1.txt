The fate of Ukrainian fighters evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol remains uncertain after some were transported to the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka near Donetsk, and some were taken to a prison colony. Russia’s defence ministry said more than 950 fighters at Azovstal have surrendered since Monday.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) confirmed that 3,752 civilians have been killed and 4,062 injured in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on February 24.
